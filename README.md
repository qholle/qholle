    Hi, I'm Quentin!

<h2>üôã About Me:</h2>

I have known computer science was the field for me ever since I discovered MIT's Scratch, an educational programming language, when I was in fourth grade. Instead of playing video games in my free time, I would make them. One of my favorite memories from these years was in 2014, when my project ["Wipeout Scratch Edition"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20340469/) was featured on the site.

I am currently a Junior at UW Madison, studying in the fields of Computer Science and Communication Arts. At the moment I am in the process of looking for an internship in the field of Computer Science for Summer 2023. 

Last summer I had the opportunity to go to San Luis Obispo, California for an internship in the field of Computer Science at Promega Biosciences. In this position I worked as an intern in the fields of IT and Software Development. Over the course of the summer I learned more about what I want to do with my career and found that I have a great love for Software Development. Going into the internship I was not knowledgeable in the field of C#, but I picked up the language very fast.  I learned countless new skills, including C#, WPF, .XAML, .NET Maui, .NET Blazor, and many more during my time at the internship. My largest project over the course of the summer was a C# application that helped my coworkers transfer and manipulate pdfs, which modernized a dated and unreliable process that was in place. Unfortunately, as the code I created was proprietary, I cannot show the projects that I worked on during this internship.

Beyond CS, I really love music. I am currently the program director for WSUM 91.7 FM in Madison, WI, which is the largest student-run radio station in North America by membership. I have had a show on the station since late 2021 when I began my show "The Time Machine," which played funk music from various eras. My new show is "Puttin' it on Wax" where I play funk vinyl. Beyond having a radio show, I also love writing about music. I am a published writer for the EMMIE Music Magazine, writing pieces on [disco](https://issuu.com/wisconsinunion/docs/final_emmie_2022_single_page_view/14) and ["quiet storm,"](https://issuu.com/wisconsinunion/docs/emmiecrushohmmeissuu/40) on top of being the publication's web director. I recently overhauled the website and I am proud of my work.

<h2>üõ† Projects:</h2>
<h3>ü§ñ Artificial Intelligence:</h3>
 <p>
  Each of the following projects are written in python. I made them for my Artificial Intelligence class which I took in the fall semester of 2022.
  </p>

<b> - Q-Learning</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/QLearning)
</br>
In this program I used the concept of Q-learning with an epsilon-greedy policy to find the optimal strategy for the OpenAI FrozenLake-v1 environment.
</br>

<b> - Minimax Algorithm</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/Minimax)
</br>
This program uses the minimax algorithm along with alpha-beta pruning in order to solve a game called Teeko.
</br>

<b> - Image Classification</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/ImageClassification)
</br>
In this project I built a neural network using the pytorch package to perform supervised learning and classify images. 
</br>

<b> - Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/HAC)
</br>
This program performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering using complete linkage.
</br>

<b> - Principal Component Analysis</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/PCA)
</br>
This project performs the principal component analysis algorithm on 32x32 image files from the Yale face dataset.
</br>

<h3>üì† C:</h3>
 <p>
  I wrote the following projects in C. I created these during the spring semester of 2022, in a machine organization class. 
  </p>

<b> - CSV Reader</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/CSVReader)
</br>
This project is an implementation of a CSV Reader in C which will fix formatting and create a formatted table from a messy .csv file.
</br>

<b> - Enigma Machine Decoder/Encoder</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/Decoder)
</br>
This application can encode and decode messagesreceived from an imitation of the enigma machine.
</br>

<b> - Linked List</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/LinkedListC)
</br>
In this project I implemented a linked list in C.
</br>

<b> - Memory Cache</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/MemoryCache)
</br>
This project is a memory cache implementation which reads the character stream from a text file.
</br>

<h3>‚òïÔ∏è Java:</h3>
 <p>
  Each of the below projects are written in java. I created these throughout my time in my Programming II and III classes (Spring 2021 - Fall 2021).
  </p>

<b> - Movie Cataloging System</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/BinarySearchTree)
</br>
In this program I implemented a binary search tree that would be used in a movie cataloging application.
</br>

<b> - Pathfinding Application</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/DjikstrasShortestPath)
</br>
In this program I utilized the Djikstra's Shortest Path algorithm to find the fastest route between points of interest.
</br>

<b> - Red Black Tree</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/RedBlackTree)
</br>
This project is a red-black tree that I implemented. I also used JUnit testing to test project functionality, which was a new concept to me at this point.
</br>

<b> - Hashtable Map</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/HashtableMap)
</br>
I created a hashtable map from scratch on this project.
</br>

<b> - Order Tracking Application</b>
(https://github.com/qholle/PriorityQueue)
</br>
Using a priority queue, I created a simple order tracking system that could be utilized in a restaurant.
</br>

<h3>üçø Miscellaneous Projects:</h3>
<b> - EMMIE Music Magazine Redesign</b>
(https://www.emmiemusic.com/)
</br>
<p>After years of neglect, the EMMIE magazine website did not look appealing. As the web director of the publication, I worked on my own to modernize the website. </p>
