    Hi, I'm Quentin!

<h2>About Me:</h2>

I have known computer science was the field for me ever since I discovered MIT's Scratch, an educational programming language, when I was in fourth grade. Instead of playing video games in my free time, I would make them. One of my favorite memories from these years was in 2014, when my project ["Wipeout Scratch Edition"](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/20340469/) was featured on the site.

I am currently a Junior at UW Madison, studying in the fields of Computer Science and Communication Arts. At the moment I am in the process of looking for an internship in the field of Computer Science for Summer 2023. 

Last summer I had the opportunity to go to San Luis Obispo, California for an internship in the field of Computer Science at Promega Biosciences. In this position I worked as an intern in the fields of IT and Software Development. Over the course of the summer I learned more about what I want to do with my career and found that I have a great love for Software Development. Going into the internship I was not knowledgeable in the field of C#, but I picked up the language very fast.  I learned countless new skills, including C#, WPF, .XAML, .NET Maui, .NET Blazor, and many more during my time at the internship. My largest project over the course of the summer was a C# application that helped my coworkers transfer and manipulate pdfs, which modernized a dated and unreliable process that was in place. 

Beyond CS, I really love music. I am currently the program director for WSUM 91.7 FM in Madison, WI, which is the largest student-run radio station in North America by membership. I have had a show on the station since late 2021 when I began my show "The Time Machine," which played funk music from various eras. My new show is "Puttin' it on Wax" where I play funk vinyl. Beyond having a radio show, I also love writing about music. I am a published writer for the EMMIE Music Magazine, writing pieces on [disco](https://issuu.com/wisconsinunion/docs/final_emmie_2022_single_page_view/14) and ["quiet storm,"](https://issuu.com/wisconsinunion/docs/emmiecrushohmmeissuu/40) on top of being the publication's web director. I recently overhauled the website and I am proud of my work.
